  The first step to using WalletWizard is to create an account. This is done by clicking "Sign up for one" on the Account Login page. From here, the user will input their Username, Email, Phone Number, Bank Account Number, Routing Number, Name, Password, and to Confirm Password. Then the user will click the user agreement and signup for their account.

  The user will go back to account login and insert their new username and password, and now they are in Wallet Wizard.

  The first page displayed in the navigation bar is the dashboard page, which displays the users username, along with amount totals for up to 3 seperate bank accounts (Although the user can click other accounts to see, display, and input other accounts information). There is a calendar where the user can add reminders for future dates and see important information regarding their bank account. There is also a pie chart which displays monetary information on it. On the side is a small button that says "ChatBat", which is an AI chatbot that helps users with any questions they have about WalletWizard. This bot will be displayed on every further page

Next page in the navigation bar is the transactions page, where the user can click the add transactions button to input the date, total amount, pay to, and status of the transaction and can select the account they are adding the transaction to. Next to these buttons is a list of all previous transactions for the selected account with all pertinent information included.

Then in the navigation bar there is a budgeting page, where the user can select a customized financial plan from three different options, Financial Plan A (high savings = low spending money)
Financial Plan B (Low Savings = More Spending Money) and Financial Plan C (Moderate Savings = Moderate Spending Money). To enact a plan for their account, the user clicks select on the bottom of each plan.  On the top of the page a graph is shown with the axis of savings x expenses, along with income and planned expenses.

Once a plan is selected, the user is taken to a page where more customization is set up. This page displays monthly income, planned monthly expenses, total disposable income, misc desired expenses, and total possible savings. You can clear the form by clicking "Clear Form" at the top, and you can save the plan by clicking "Save and Select Plan" at the bottom.

The next page in the navigation bar is the Contact page, where the user can send messages directly to the WalletWizard team. They have the option of this message being a Request, a Complaint, or a Message. There are two buttons at the bottom, one for "Send" and one for "Reset"

The next page is the profile page, which displays user profile data. This includes Name, Username, Email, Phone Number, and Password. There is also an edit profile button that takes the user to a new page where they can add a new password. 

Then for the final button in navigation, there is a "Log Out" button, which logs the user out of Wallet Wizard.
